### 2.5.1 Document metadata
**Model developer or data engineer**: Document model and project metadata, including the name of the model owner, timestamps, statistical analysis tools and the version used, model performance at training time, and any other relevant information.

### 2.5.2 Document testing strategy
**Model developer or data engineer**: Document the model testing strategy in
accordance with the *NIST AI RMF Playbook* guidelines in Measure
[1.1](https://airc.nist.gov/AI_RMF_Knowledge_Base/Playbook/Measure#Measure%201.1).
Consider the following questions when developing the testing strategy.
Note that answers to the questions do not need to be explicitly documented in the testing strategy.
Rather, the questions can guide the development of the strategy itself, which should be documented in this step.

1. Are there systemic differences between the data that you use to train the model, the data that you use to test the model, and the data about the population or setting into which the AI system will be deployed?

   Such differences could be related to any of the following:
   - representativeness
   - missing data
   - input data distributions
   - output data distributions
  
2. Should the model be tested in out-of-distribution samples?
3. How does the model behave when encountering values not included in the training data? 
4. Are training and testing samples independent? What method was used to create the training and testing data sets?

[5.1](https://airc.nist.gov/AI_RMF_Knowledge_Base/Playbook/Map#Map%205.1).
Protected classes are groups of people who are legally protected from discrimination based on a shared characteristic.
Classes can include age, ancestry, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity or expression, genetic information, HIV/AIDS status, military status, national origin, pregnancy, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, and veteran status.
Legally defined protected classes can vary by country or region.

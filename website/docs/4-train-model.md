# 4. Train and assess model
Train and assess a set of models to help find the best model for production.
## 4.1 Train models
**Model developer**: Train and fine-tune several models. Document a set of promising models. Note the location of the models and modeling assets:

</br>

## 4.2 Document model evaluation metrics
**Model developer**: Document all fit statistics used for model evaluation. Note resulting values for promising models.

## 4.3 Assess model bias

### 4.3.1 Model needs bias evaluation?
**Model developer**: Does the model require bias evaluation, based on the implications for the use of the AI system, among other factors?

* [ ] Yes. If selected, continue to the next step.
* [ ] No. If selected, move to step [4.3.4](#4.3.4-Bias-metrics-differences-approval).

If applicable, add any additional details:

### 4.3.2 Compare and document subgroup model performance
**Model developer**: Calculate and compare model performance values and additional fairness metrics for each protected class or subgroup.
To calculate model performance values, use model performance metrics defined by your organization in the testing strategy outlined in [step 2.1.6]((2-document-project.md). Fairness metrics might include equal opportunity, demographic parity, predictive parity, equal accuracy, or equalized odds. Subgroups are often protected classes. However, they could be important groups within the data based on the model use case, even though they are not legally defined as protected classes.

### 4.3.3 Compare abd document average model predictions per subgroup
**Model developer**: Calculate and compare average model predictions for each protected class or subgroup.
Protected classes are groups of people who are legally protected from discrimination based on a shared characteristic, like disability, sexual orientation, or race.
Subgroups are often protected classes. However, they could be important groups within the data based on the model use case, even though they are not legally defined as protected classes.

### 4.3.4 Bias metrics differences approval
**Model owner**: Is the documentation provided by the model developer satisfactor? If bias evaluation is required, are the differences in bias metric values satisfactory?

* [ ] Yes
* [ ] No

If no, which areas need additional review?

* [ ]  Retrain models with new data. If selected, please return to [step 3](3-prepare-and-assess-data.md).
* [ ]  Fine tune the models with existing data. If selected, return to [step 4](4-train-model.md).
* [ ]  Set a new champion model. If selected, please return to [step 5](5-test-model.md).
* [ ]  Update the project documentation, if selected, please return to [step 2](2-document-project.md). 
* [ ]  End the workflow. If selected, please depreciate the project and update [step 2.1.1](2-document-project.md). 
* [ ]  Move forward with the model. If selected, please continue with step 6 and provide additional details or justification below.

## 4.4 Assess model explainability

### 4.4.1 Is model explainability important?
**Model developer**: Is model explainability or interpretability important for this use case?
An explainable model allows human users to comprehend and trust the results of the output generated by the model. Explainability is important in most use cases.

Is explainability important for this use case?

* [ ] Yes. If selected, continue to the next step. 
* [ ] No. If selected, move to step [4.4.3](#4.4.3-Model-explanations-approval). 

If applicable, add any additional details:

### 4.4.2 Document model explainability
**Model developer**: Document model explainability method and results.
Ensure that explainability information is made available to the model end user.Select the most appropriate explainability methods for the use case and model type.
SAS Viya includes explainability tools such as Partial Dependence (PD) plots, Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME), and Kernel Shapley values (Kernel SHAP). These techniques are model-agnostic, which means that these techniques can be applied to any model that is generated by a supervised learning node.

### 4.4.3 Model explanations approval
**Model owner**: Is the documentation provided by the model developer satisfactor? If explanability is required, are the models' level of explainability acceptable?

* [ ] Yes
* [ ] No

If no, which areas need additional review?

* [ ]  Retrain models with new data. If selected, please return to [step 3](3-prepare-and-assess-data.md).
* [ ]  Fine tune the models with existing data. If selected, return to [step 4](4-train-model.md).
* [ ]  Set a new champion model. If selected, please return to [step 5](5-test-model.md).
* [ ]  Update the project documentation, if selected, please return to [step 2](2-document-project.md). 
* [ ]  End the workflow. If selected, please depreciate the project and update [step 2.1.1](2-document-project.md). 
* [ ]  Move forward with the model. If selected, please continue with step 6 and provide additional details or justification below.
